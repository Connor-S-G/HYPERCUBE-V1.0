# HYPERCUBE-V1.0
This is a GUI created in Python for viewing a 3D visualisation of a 4D shape called a 'Hypercube' (a.k.a 'Tesseract'). It is also possible to switch between a cube and a hypercube to compare the two shapes.
## Prerequisites
Must have Python with Pygame + Pygame-gui installed.
## Main Menu
The title screen that is displayed when launched.

## Manipulating the hypercube using 4D axis
Sliders are used to transform the shape.

## Project Details

This project taught me a lot about implementing mathematics into a program. I had to use lots of matrix transformations to get the cube and hypercube to rotate correctly. I also learnt about creating a python GUI, which isn't the traditional way of creating a GUI.
